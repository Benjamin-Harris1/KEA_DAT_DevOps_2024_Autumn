# Exam report requirements

**Motivation**: The exam report is written by the group and will be read by me and the censor.

## Requirements

**Deadline**: Check the deadline on WiseFlow. Remember to create groups yourselves when you submit the report. The exam plan will be created based on the groups you create.

You are allowed to work on the project after handing in the report.

**Language**: Danish/English

**Length**: Max 8 pages

Rules per the study curriculum:

- A page is defined as 2400 characters (including spaces).

- Images are counted as much as the space that they take up. If you make the images too small to be read without digitally zooming in, then it will be considered as imcomprehensible.

Please add the necessary images and diagrams instead of writing 8 pages of text.

If you exceed the limit, then anything above the limit will not count towards the grade.

## Report formalities

Include: 

- Group name (as per `repositories.py`) and student names with KEA mail and GitHub usernames (if applicable).

- Page numbers

**Justify margins**: The entire report text (except titles) must be justified on both sides. To get you started, here is how you can do it in Google Docs and Word:

Justifying text helps readability and gives the report a professional look.

You will be docked if you do not do this.

## Sections to include

Since the mandatories specify a set of documents that you must bring to the exam, it would be interesting to allow you complete freedom for the exam report. 

Giving an overview of the setup with diagram(s) is a good start, though.

My advice: Keep it concise!
